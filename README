First stab Dojo Api, the current generated api in dojoApi dir.

To create the api from the api.json then ...

haxe -debug -D nodejs -cp . -cp ../core -js genapi.js -main Create

This requires the bdog-stdhx project and node installed to generate it.

then run

node genapi.js

to generate the dojoApi dir.

Then to test that the api is at least compiling

haxe -cp . -D nodejs -js all.hs -main All

All.hx is generated during the node genapi.js process to provide a
compilation of all classes in one place.

For most peeps not interested in tweaking the api just set your cp to the
dojoApi dir.
